# Year 1 Research Project
# Isometries in Euclidian Space, Patterns & Space Groups

This is an independent research project I worked on during my first year at Imperial College London. This is a literature project, in which I explore transformations in euclidian space, lattices and corresponding space groups (transoformations under which the lattice or pattern remains unchanged). Patters in two dimensions are visualised using software available online at (https://math.hws.edu/eck/js/symmetry/)
The report is written in Latex.

Please have a read!
